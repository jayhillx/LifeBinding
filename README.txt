# Life Binding
[Life Binding](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/life-binding) is a mod included in the YouTube SMP Series 'X Life'.
This mod is a recreation of that mod.
If two players each consumed a potion of Life Binding and are near each other, they will become life bound. When life bound, when one player dies, the other will also die. Nothing can prevent a player from dying, commands, milk, logging out, the totem of undying, NOTHING. If a player is offline whilst the other dies, the next time they log in they will die.
